Refactor for Marketing Agency
This repository is where I refactored a SEO webpage with semantic HTML and accessability to maximise SEO for a marketing agency. My aim was to create a codebase that follows accessibility standrds beacuse it plays an important role in SEO. I also reworked the HTML and CSS to make it more efficient by consolidating CSS selectors and properties. During this project I learnt how to use semantic HTML and the importance of class and Id attributes.
